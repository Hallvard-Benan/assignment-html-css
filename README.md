Report:
The design choices i made during the bulding of this site were mostly already made during the design assignment. However i did make some changes.

The feedback i got in the design-assignment made me reconsider the mobile version, as the desktop version of the design was more usable. The changes i made were mostly to make the mobile version more like the desktop version, but hide the nav in a hamburger-menu, and adjust sizes and position of elements to acount for responsiveness.

I adjusted the font-sizes for readability and emphasis, and changed the font from avenir to montserrat, as it was the most similar font that was free.

The purple used in the buttons is now slightly lighter than the one for background of the checkout-page, for the sake of better contrast.

I added form-inputs to the contact-page for the users email and name.

There are alot of design I have thought about and contemplated, but not implemented. A hover-effect on each poster in the video-lists that "reveals" a title and either a "buy"-button or a play-button. Also a button for the horizontal scrolling-section.
Also, the hamburger-button moves when on screensizes larger than Iphone-SE, which was how I did most my testing.
